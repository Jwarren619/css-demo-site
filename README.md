## The Format of the index.html

 I changed the header class to a regular sematic element header on line 12 and removed the class in my css as well.

The div class in line 29 was changed to main. As a sematic element belonged there.

I edited the footer class in line 77 and changed it to the sematic element of footer. I did the same in the css also.


# Comments
I added a couple of comments in my index.html to help better understand my changes.
